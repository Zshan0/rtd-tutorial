VM6502Q and Qrack
=================

Introduction
------------
An introductory talk to QRack can be found here `Intro to Qrack: a framework for fast quantum simulation by Daniel Strano | Quantum Software Talks <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxyqJDC4SUo>`_.

`Qrack <https://github.com/vm6502q/qrack>`_ is a C++ quantum bit and gate simulator, with the ability to support arbitrary numbers of entangled qubits - up to system limitations.  Suitable for embedding in other projects, the :cpp:class:`Qrack::QInterface` contains a full and performant collection of standard quantum gates, as well as variations suitable for register operations and arbitrary rotations.
